## 개요

### 진행과제

Users should be able to:

- 기기의 화면 크기에 따른 최적의 사이트 레이아웃 보기
- 페이지의 모든 대화형 요소에 대한 호버 상태 보기
- 마우스/트랙패드 또는 키보드를 사용하여 슬라이더 탐색

### 스크린샷

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**
